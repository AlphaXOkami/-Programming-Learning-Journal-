# Day 1 of programming, introduction.
Started the lesson talking about programming as a whole and what's expected of us this semester in terms of course work. Also introduced to Github, and how we're going to be writing on our journey, and essentially updating our journal using Github. Being able to understand how it works as well as how to work repositories and sort out work as we go along. Learning as well that it's a collaberative space, but while I know what it is I still have a lot to learn regarding what and how to work with Github more in due time.
Did some excersises through Games that Paul set us, and essentially tried one that tested our memories and collaberative work with another person to mimic how us as users input data into a computer through a programming language. 

We were also told that we'll be working on learning tutorials and then updating our journal accordingly with how, we followed certain steps and whatnot, as if we're teaching someone else so that it could be in our minds. Starting next week. 

We also learned a bit about the scientific method which is in the name, A hypothesis that essentially we try to prove right but instead prove wrong, by trying various possibilities to find something wrong, now it's possible to get infinite correct answers so the lesson here, is that we take what we can and run with it. If it works in a solid manner it works and if it doesn't then it doesn't. In terms of code, learnt some basic things such as what {} do, and what && mean as well. 

So overall a general good beginning and introduction to programming in our second year and I'm looking forward to what's next.
